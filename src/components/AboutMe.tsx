        Iâ€™m Gerry, a creatively minded individual new to software development
        and eager to dive into new and exciting opportunities. I have experience
        in full stack development with a focus in front-end UI / UX. I tend to
        think that people prefer to look at stuff that looks nice, so where
        better to begin than with visual design.
